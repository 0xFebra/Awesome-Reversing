# Awesome Reverse Engineering [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

(n) Art and science of **breaking** something down, **extracting** design and mechanics behind, and **manipulating** into its basic principle.

Reversing is the process of, partially or fully, recovering the design, requirement specifications, and functions of a product from an analysis of object.

## Contents

Reverse Engineering is a large topic, so we divide it into several specializations:

- [Software Reverse Engineering](#software-reverse-engineering)
- [Hardware Reverse Engineering](#hardware-reverse-engineering)
- [Format Reverse Engineering](#format-reverse-engineering)
- [Database Reverse Engineering](#database-reverse-engineering)

## Software Reverse Engineering

Read the [list](_software.md).

Software Reverse Engineering focus on code, related data, and architecture which build a complete software.

In most case, the target of Software Reversing is code in compiled form (native or intermediate), either executable or libraries.

## Hardware Reverse Engineering

Read the [list](_hardware.md)

Hardware Reverse Engineering focus on circuitry (boards, ICs) and intercomponent relation. 

## Format Reverse Engineering

Read the [list](_format.md)

Data Format Reverse Engineering focus on representation and interpretation of structured data in stored or transmitted form.

## Database Reverse Engineering

Read the [list](_database.md)

Database Reverse Engineering focus on collection of structured data (entities) and relationship among them.
